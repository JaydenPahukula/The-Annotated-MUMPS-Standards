# The Annotated M\[UMPS\] Standards

This is a copy of [The Annotated M[UMPS] Standards](http://71.174.62.16/Demo/AnnoStd) by Ed De Moel.

Too much documentation on the Mumps programming language has been lost to time (or paywalls).
This document has been invaluable in my Mumps research, so I wanted to preserve it, just case in the original version goes down.

The content itself is in its original state, but I had to modify a little bit of the website code to convert it to a static site.
That means I had to remove the search bar, as well as the Literature, Quick Jump, and Implementation pages (most of the links were broken anyway).
The one feature that I did add was url parameters, so that you can bookmark pages and use browser history properly.
