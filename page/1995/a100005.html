<p>Section 1 consists of nine clauses that describe the MUMPS
language. Clause 1 describes the metalanguage used in the
remainder of Section 1 for the static syntax. The remaining
clauses describe the static syntax and overall semantics of the
language. The distinction between &ldquo;static&rdquo; and &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; syntax
is as follows. The static syntax describes the sequence of
characters in a routine as it appears on a tape in routine
interchange or on a listing. The dynamic syntax describes the
sequence of characters that would be encountered by an
interpreter during execution of the routine. (There is no
requirement that MUMPS actually be interpreted). The dynamic
syntax takes into account transfers of control and values
produced by indirection.</p>

<p>Clauses 10 through 21 highlight, for the benefit of
implementors and application programmers, aspects of the language
that must be accorded special attention if M program
transferability (i.e., portability of source code between various
M implementations) is to be achieved. It provides a
specification of limits that must be observed by both
implementors and programmers if portability is not to be ruled
out. To this end, implementors <u>must meet or exceed</u> these
limits, treating them as a minimum requirement. Any implementor
who provides definitions in currently undefined areas must take
into account that this action risks jeopardizing the upward
compatibility of the implementation, upon subsequent revision of
the M Language Specification. Application programmers striving to
develop portable programs must take into account the danger of
employing &quot;unilateral extensions&quot; to the language made
available by the implementor.</p>

<p>The following definitions apply to the use of the terms
<i>explicit limit</i> and <i>implicit limit</i> within this
document. An explicit limit is one which applies directly to a
referenced language construct. Implicit limits on language
constructs are second-order effects resulting from explicit
limits on other language constructs. For example, the explicit
command line length restriction places an implicit limit on the
length of any construct which must be expressed entirely within a
single command line.</p>

<p>Clauses 22 through 24 describe the binding between M and ANSI
X3.64. ANSI X3.64 is a functional standard for additional control
functions for data interchange with two-dimensional
character-imaging input and/or output devices. It is an ANSI
standard, but also an ISO standard with roughly similar
characteristics exists (ISO 2022). As such, it has been
implemented in many devices worldwide. It is expected that M can
be easily adapted to these implementations.</p>

<p>The standard defined as ANSI X3.64 defines a format for
device-control. No physical device is required to be able to
perform all possible control-functions. In reality, as some
functions rely on certain physical properties of specific
devices, no device will be able to perform all functions. The
standard, however, does not specify which functions a device
should be able to do, but if it is able to perform a function,
how the control-information for this function is to be
specified.</p>

<p>This binding is to the functional definitions included in
X3.64. The actual dialogue between the M implementation and the
device is left to the implementor.</p>
