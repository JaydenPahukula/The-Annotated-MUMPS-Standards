<p>A transition diagram is a network of no es and directed paths
with at least one entrance node (indicated by the symbol
<img alt="Circle E" align="middle" src="/image/AnnoStd/circle_e.gif"/> or the symbol
<img alt="Triangle N" align="middle" src="/image/AnnoStd/triangle_n.gif"/>,
where n is an integer such as 1, 2, 3, etc.), , and at least one
exit node (indicated by one of the following four symbols
<img alt="Circle W" align="middle" src="/image/AnnoStd/circle_w.gif"/>,
<img alt="Circle X" align="middle" src="/image/AnnoStd/circle_x.gif"/>,
<img alt="Circle Y" align="middle" src="/image/AnnoStd/circle_y.gif"/>,
<img alt="Circle Z" align="middle" src="/image/AnnoStd/circle_z.gif"/>;
<img alt="Circle X" align="middle" src="/image/AnnoStd/circle_x.gif"/> is the "normal" exit).</p>

<p>Each transition diagram defines a syntactic type, whose name
is written in underscored lower-case letters, e.g., <span onclick="document.form.Edition.value='1977';GetText('ShowPage', 'a107001', 'scroll', 'Def_0001');" onmouseover="HighLight(this, 1, 'lightblue');" onmouseout="HighLight(this, 0, '');" style="color: blue;"><u>expr</u></span>.
A string being scanned through a "window" which looks at one
character at a time is declared to be an instance of the
syntactic type defined by a diagram if and only if the algorithm
given below exactly scans the string while traversing the
transition diagram from an entrance node to an exit node.</p>

<p>Each directed path from one node to another node is either
associated with a symbol "on" that path, or the path is "blank".
If a path has a symbol on it, the symbol can be either the name
of a syntactic type defined by a transition diagram, implying a
"call" (possibly recursive) to that diagram, or a symbol from the
primitive alphabet. The primitive alphabet consists of the 95
ASCII graphics, including <span onclick="document.form.Edition.value='1977';GetText('ShowPage', 'a105002', 'scroll', 'Def_0004');" onmouseover="HighLight(this, 1, 'lightblue');" onmouseout="HighLight(this, 0, '');" style="color: blue;">SP</span> (space), plus <span onclick="document.form.Edition.value='1977';GetText('ShowPage', 'a106001', 'scroll', 'Def_0007');" onmouseover="HighLight(this, 1, 'lightblue');" onmouseout="HighLight(this, 0, '');" style="color: blue;"><u>ls</u></span>, <span onclick="document.form.Edition.value='1977';GetText('ShowPage', 'a106001', 'scroll', 'Def_0008');" onmouseover="HighLight(this, 1, 'lightblue');" onmouseout="HighLight(this, 0, '');" style="color: blue;"><u>eol</u></span>,
<span onclick="document.form.Edition.value='1977';GetText('ShowPage', 'a106001', 'scroll', 'Def_0009');" onmouseover="HighLight(this, 1, 'lightblue');" onmouseout="HighLight(this, 0, '');" style="color: blue;"><u>eor</u></span>,
and <u>eoi</u> (the <u>eoi</u> character is used to indicate the
end of argument or sub-argument level indirection; its actual
form is not defined).</p>

<p>The scanning algorithm works as follows. In the next
paragraph, the rule for following a path from one node to the
next node is given. Once that can be done, the rule is applied
iteratively starting at an entrance node until an exit node is
encountered. At this point, a call to the diagram just traversed
has been completed, and the path which made the call may be
traversed. If a dead end is reached, and the window has not moved
since entering the diagram, it only means that the call to this
diagram has not succeeded and another path must be attempted. If
a dead end is reached after moving the window over at least one
input symbol since the entrance node, this is the indication of a
syntax error.</p>

<p>The rule for leaving a node is as follows. All nonblank paths
are tried, with primitive symbols tried first, then calls to
other diagrams. The blank path, if it is present, provides the
default case and is taken only after all other paths fail. A path
with a primitive symbol on it may be traversed if and only if the
symbol in the window equals the symbol on the path. In this case,
the path is traversed and the window is moved one position to the
right. A path with a call to a transition diagram may be
traversed if and only if a call to that diagram results in
successfully reaching an exit node of that diagram. Any window
movement arising from a call to a diagram will be done within the
called diagram.</p>

<p>Any path can direct the performance of an action, indicated by
a number in a square box on the path. The action may be performed
after the path is traversed. Certain actions, called "privileged
actions", are always executed after traversing the path on which
they appear; all other actions are executed only if both the
semantic action flags Linact and Comact are True (see the
scanning algorithm). Note that the actions within a called
diagram precede the action specified on the path of the call.</p>

<p>If a diagram contains only one exit type, the X type is used.
If it contains W, X, Y and/or Z, the exit actually used as a
result of a given call may be tested by the caller. The notation
used is as follows.</p>

<table>
<tr><td align="center">single-exit diagram</td>
<td align="center">multiple-exit diagram</td></tr>
<tr><td align="center"><img alt="AnnoStd" src="/image/AnnoStd/1977_p02a.svg" width="105" height="175"/></td>
<td align="center"><img alt="AnnoStd" src="/image/AnnoStd/1977_p02b.svg" width="200" height="380"/></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Actions generally make reference to temporary variables, such
as A, B, C, D (see the diagram for the <span onclick="document.form.Edition.value='1977';GetText('ShowPage', 'a107101', 'scroll', 'Def_0006');" onmouseover="HighLight(this, 1, 'lightblue');" onmouseout="HighLight(this, 0, '');" style="color: blue;">$PIECE</span> function). These
variables are strictly local to each invocation of a diagram. A
communication variable "Result" is used to pass values among
diagrams.</p>

<p>Two branching notations are used in the diagrams. These are
illustrated below.</p>

<table>
<tr><td align="center"><img alt="AnnoStd" src="/image/AnnoStd/1977_p03a.svg" width="130" height="150"/></td>
<td align="center"><img alt="AnnoStd" src="/image/AnnoStd/1977_p03b.svg" width="130" height="150"/></td></tr>
</table>

<p>Notation 1 indicates that this syntactic construct continues a
the <img alt="Circle E" align="middle" src="/image/AnnoStd/circle_e.gif"/> entrance
of the named diagram. In other words, whenever the
<img alt="Hexagon B" align="middle" src="/image/AnnoStd/hexagon_b.gif"/> (branch)
symbol is encountered, the logical flow is transferred to the
beginning of the diagram whose name appears to the right of the
<img alt="Hexagon B" align="middle" src="/image/AnnoStd/hexagon_b.gif"/>.
This construct is merely a convenient
notation for presentation of the diagrams. Notation 2 indicates a
transfer of control to a specific entry point (other than the
<img alt="Circle E" align="middle" src="/image/AnnoStd/circle_e.gif"/> entrance) in
the named diagram. The n in
the symbol <img alt="Triangle N" align="middle" src="/image/AnnoStd/triangle_n.gif"/> is an integer which
indicates the number of the entry point in the diagram whose name
appears to the right of the <img alt="Triangle N" align="middle" src="/image/AnnoStd/triangle_n.gif"/>.
This construct is used primarily to show clearly the control flow in
the MUMPS language from DO, FOR, and XECUTE commands.</p>

<p>One other construct used in the diagrams is shown below.</p>

<p><img alt="AnnoStd" src="/image/AnnoStd/1977_p03c.svg" width="170" height="250"/></p>

<p>The logical value of "condition" is tested. If it is True,
path 1 is taken. If it is False, path 2 is taken.</p>

<p>The scanning algorithm on the next page is used to move from
one "syntax node" to the next (a syntax node is denoted by a
circle). Any of the intervening branching or testing nodes
discussed above are taken automatically. The variable "case" in
the algorithm is used for determining the actual exit from a
diagram call with multiple exit. Underlined parts of the
algorithm represent operations which have not undergone detailed
stepwise refinement.</p>

<p>To execute a MUMPS routine, the window is initially positioned
to the first character of the text of the routine, and the
<span onclick="document.form.Edition.value='1977';GetText('ShowPage', 'a106001', 'scroll', 'Def_0001');" onmouseover="HighLight(this, 1, 'lightblue');" onmouseout="HighLight(this, 0, '');" style="color: blue;"><u>routine</u></span> diagram in Section 2 is invoked. The algorithm
below then scans through the routine text using this diagram and
all subsequently called diagrams.</p>
